For those curious, I am using GitHub Pages to host the site, which is composed in two separate sections:

- Resume/Bio
- Travel Blog

The first section is built using a modified bootstrap template dating back from my summer at CMU. The resume portion of the website gave me a quick and dirty rundown on **CSS** and **HTML**. And by quick and dirty, I mean I have only just enough knowledge to be dangerous, but not enough to have any clue what exactly is going on.

The blog however, is built using Jekyll, a static site generator. Here I integrated a Jekyll template made by [minimalmistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/). Most of this work involved learning some **Ruby** (AKA downloading it and copying commands). Finally, the comment section required some basic **JavaScript** and **Liquid** manipulation.



Overall, I probably spent *30 hours* on the bio and *15 hours* on the blog.
